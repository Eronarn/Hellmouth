Global todo:

- Make everything using dirs use dir[NW] etc. rather than importing dirs separately.
- Convert colors to default to a black background.
- Make all pos functions accept tuple args consistently.
- Write a wrapper so that curses never, ever tries to print something offscreen.
- Clean up the game loop
