Global todo:

DISPLAY:

- Convert colors to default to a black background.
- Support 256 colors.

UTILITY:
- Make everything using dirs use dir[NW] etc. rather than importing dirs separately.
- Make all pos functions accept tuple args consistently.
- Write a wrapper so that curses never, ever tries to print something offscreen.

STRUCTURE:
- Clean up the game loop
- Move color stuff out of define.py
