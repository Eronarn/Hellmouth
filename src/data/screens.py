As the daze of the teleport spell fades away, you realize that you are not \
where you - nor anyone - would want to be. Towering walls of meat glisten in \
the dim bioluminescent light. A side of beef sloughs off the nearest one as \
you watch. The scent of <red-black>blood</> is heavy in the air, and your boots sink into \
the ground-beef ominously.\
<br>\
<br>\
This is a grisly, gristly place. You must escape.\

Unfortunately, the staircase leading upwards has been stuffed with stuffing. \
The only way you can go is down.",

You trudge down the spiral ham staircase, pausing only to wipe some steak \
sauce from your brow. You almost slip a few times in the dim light, but the \
passage soon brightens again - you must be near an exit.\
<br>\
<br>\
Or an entrance.\
<br>\
<br>\
The gaping cavity at the end of the tunnel opens into another \
level much like the first. It looks like you'll have to keep looking for an \
exit from this bizarre place!",

Even before you round the stairs, it is clear that this level is different \
from the last. You hear neither the chattering of meat slaves nor the roaring \
of hydras. In fact, apart from the ever-present gurgle of uneasy digestion, it \
is totally silent.\
<br>\
<br>\
It takes your eyes a few moments to adjust to the dimmer light. You've exited \
the staircase into a straight corridor lined by pillars. At the other side is \
a tremendous gate built from the spine of a blue whale - that must be the exit! \
<br>\
<br>\
Unfortunately, it seems to be guarded. A tall humanoid creature composed of \
truly prodigious amounts of meat stands at attention. It quickly notices your \
presence and bellows a challenge.\

The guard raises its maul and charges brazenly down the corridor at you.",

As you pass through the gate, you come to understand the reason for its \
construction. The meat beyond it is older - less tender, to be sure, but far \
wiser. You shiver with anticipation as you imagine the great power that must \
run through the veins of such a place.\
<br>\

Then you remember that this primal meat was sealed away by something powerful \
enough that even the Meat Commander saw fit to swear fealty to it. Again, you \
shiver.",

The gurgling of the walls intensifies as you walk down this set of stairs. It \
becomes hotter, too, and you find yourself sweating almost as much as the \
ceiling. You are not comforted when you find the source of the noiset: large \
pipes of intestine that bulge from the floor and spew sauce into ever-growing \
pools. \

As you get closer to the sauce vats, you notice that they are boiling. \

A single massive kielbasa stabs through the roast beef at the center of this \
cavern. It must be the source of the sauce, for it radiates an awful heat, and \
large sections of intestinal tubing exit its casing to enter into the meaty \
walls.\
<br>\
<br>\
A dark-robed figure stands in front of the towering kielbasa. It traces arcane \
glyphs with sausage fingers while chanting words in the dark meat speech. The \
very air drips with eldritch grease.\

This must be the home of the Sauceror that the Meat Commander spoke of. It is \
clearly a being both insanely powerful and powerfully insane.",

Meat Arena is a short game that I created to serve as a prototype & testing \
suite for Hellmouth, a much longer game that I hope to release this year. Your \
character in Hellmouth is a demonslayer who travels across Medieval Europe in \
search of Satan's minions. While you may fit the traditional archetype of a \
paladin blazing with the light of God, demonslayers are a varied lot: some \
prefer to dispatch their foes with subterfuge, while others use their charisma \
to rally peasant armies. A few dark souls even risk eternal hellfire by \
embracing the corrupt powers of Hell.\
<br><br>\
You can follow Hellmouth's development at:\
<br><br>\
    http://eronarn.info/tag/hellmouth/ or https://github.com/Eronarn/Hellmouth\
<br><br>\
I want to improve Meat Arena because Hellmouth will be based on its code. I'd \
really appreciate any feedback that you have to offer:\
