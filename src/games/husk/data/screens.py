Husk is my failed 7DRL from 2013. I built using the framework intended for\
Hellmouth, a much longer game that I hope to release one day. Your character in\
Hellmouth is a demonslayer who travels across Medieval Europe in search of \
Satan's minions. While you may fit the traditional archetype of a \
paladin blazing with the light of God, demonslayers are a varied lot, and \
others prefer to dispatch their foes with subterfuge or use their charisma to \
rally peasant armies. A few dark souls even risk eternal damnation by \
embracing the corrupt powers of Hell...\

You can follow Hellmouth's development at:\

    http://eronarn.info/tag/hellmouth/ or https://github.com/Eronarn/Hellmouth\
<br><br>\
I want to improve Husk because Hellmouth will be based on its code. I'd really\
appreciate any feedback that you have to offer:\

Thanks again for playing!",
