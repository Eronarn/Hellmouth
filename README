The forces of darkness are gathering in the hidden places of the world. As a demon slayer, it is your calling to put an end to their plans. You must find the Hellmouth and seal it at any cost!

Hellmouth will focus on in-depth tactical combat rather than resource management or a gameplay clock. You'll have few fights, but they'll be *hard*. Development will take place on Github (https://github.com/Eronarn/Hellmouth). I'll be posting daily development updates on 7drl.org as well as longer design articles on my personal site.

Planned features:
* Hex grid
* Diverse fighting styles and weaponry
* Locational damage and called shots
* Active defense options (parrying, retreating, etc.)
* Moderate historical accuracy
